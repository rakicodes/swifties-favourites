# How It's Made
Technologies used: MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, EJS

I built this website using the MERN stack and the MVC framework. For the backend, the database uses MongoDB and the server is implemented using NodeJS. For the frontend, I used EJS to dynamically update the HTML and I also use TailwindCSS for the styling.


# Optimizations
Improving the ui and adding more features like adding other swifties as friends and seeing their profile.
